# EJS Language Support #

Syntax highlighting for EJS, Javascript, and HTML tags. Includes javascript autocompletion.

Please rate this and provide feedback for 2 reasons:

1. It helps me know what I need to improve. *Can't fix what I don't know*
2. It will help other know that this version is out there and that it is a newer version of the top ranked EJS language file. *Old one has not had an update in 7 years (as of 2018)*

If there is anything that I missed or features you would like this to include. [Let me know](https://github.com/Digitalbrainstem/ejs-grammar/issues)

*NOTE: This is in early development; however, it does provide greater functionality than the other ejs language supports.*
