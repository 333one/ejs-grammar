# EJS Language Support

Syntax highlighting for EJS, Javascript, and HTML tags.
Javascript AutoCompletion.

If this is working for you, please rate this so that others will choose this version as the other version is 7 years (as of 2018) out of date.

If you want to see any features or if there is something I missed let me know on GitHub

NOTE: This is in early development; however, it does provide greater functionality than the other ejs language supports.
